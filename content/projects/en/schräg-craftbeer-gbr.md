## Introduction

Through the course of a long-term university project I was tasked to create a corporate design for a fictional craftbeer company. A corporate design encases the graphic identity of a company. It consists of designs, templates and guidlines that all follow the same branding in order to create a unified and professional appearence. We were mostly given creative freedom concerning the name, logo and bottle label design of the company with the only requirement being defined guidelines for final submission. The final submission itself was made up of a logo, a keyvisual, the company's business card, a blank letter template and the actual beer label.
