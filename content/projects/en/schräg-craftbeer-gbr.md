Through the course of a long-term university project I was tasked to create a corporate design for a fictional craft beer company. We were given creative freedom concerning the name, logo and bottle label design of the company with the only requirement being defined guidelines for the final submission. The final submission itself was made up of a logo, a key-visual, the company's business card, a blank letter template and the actual beer label.

## First Steps

After a short brainstorming session I drew up a few sketches for my design and eventually settled on three main contenders which you can see below.

Because I was aiming at a more none-traditional design targeting a young audience, I chose the second design to finalized. It should be mentioned that the chosen option is a sketch of the beer label and key visual and not the actual logo, the logo itself was later designed around the selected concept. The next step was to create a redefined version of my sketch. For this process I mainly used a combination of Adobe software such as Illustrator and Photoshop.

## Document Template & Business Card

As soon as the final logo design had been established, I began working on the business card and the letter template. This was mainly done with the use of Adobe Indesign and DIN-Format templates to ensure its compatability when printing. The names and addresses in the design were given by the assignment's specifications. The final results can be seen below.

## Beer Label

The final step of this project was to create a label for the actual beer bottle. I began by creating a refined version of my sketch in Adobe Illustrator and started adding details fitting to the theme of the logo and key visual. One of these details was the background of the label which I filled with traditional proverbs synonymous to the subject of beer. I also added the key visual at the top of the label to ensure recognition of the company. To give an impression on how the label would look on a real beer bottle I used a commercially free mockup from [Simon Stratford](http://simonstratford.com/), which can be seen below.
